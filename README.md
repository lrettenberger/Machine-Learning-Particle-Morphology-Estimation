# Uncertainty Aware Particle Segmentation for SEM Data

Repository for our [npj Computational Materials](https://www.nature.com/npjcompumats/) publication accessible at: XXX


This repository contains two directories: **export_high_magnification** and **export_low_magnification**. We have discovered that the segmentation works best when distinguishing between high magnification scans and low magnification scans.

- **High Magnification Scans:** These are scans with a magnification over 10,000×.
- **Low Magnification Scans:** These are scans with a magnification below 10,000×.

In principle however, both models operate in the same way. 

## Instructions

Detailed instructions on how to apply our segmentation models can be found in the respective Readme.md files located in both directories. Please refer to these files for guidance on utilizing the models effectively. 

If you have any questions or encounter issues, feel free to reach out to us. We're here to help!

## DLIP
The DLIP directory contains the source code to train our model on your own data.
